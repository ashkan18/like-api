From specs given by a game team, implement an API on Google AppEngine to be used by their mobile app, available on GitHub.
Special care should be given to performances and scalability of the API.
Specs:
- For each level in our game, we want the ability for the player to like it and add a comment.

- The flow in our app is this way: the user plays a level, then at the end he can see the number of people who liked it and the number of comments.
The player has then the option to see the list of comments and add one, or he can also like the level.

Then on the user profile page we want to display which levels he liked.
Please tell us which end-point calling with which parameters."
